Whilst searching for recordings from my mum's 30th birthday party amongst three full boxes of VHS tapes. I had thought that it would be great if there was a service that allows you to convert these tapes into digital files. After spending some time on Google, it was evident that the services of the likes already exist and were thriving. There was even a company that focussed on archiving CCTV footage for companies. The only thing I noticed was that all their websites were totally outdated and pricing was very expensive.

Jumping from the problem and idea to the first iteration happened really quickly.  I already owned a domain name that seemed fitting: Forgottentapes.com. I proceeded to set up a Shopify store. This was my first time setting one up, and it wasn’t as straightforward It's proclaimed to be. I encountered a few minor annoyances along the way:

I needed an address for the tapes to be posted to and the idea of making this my home address made me slightly uneasy. This was solved by paying for a virtual business address service. 

Setting up Google Ads if you’ve never used it is not for the weak. The UI isn’t great and establishing whether the campaign is optimal is a skill in itself.

The only equipment that was needed was a VHS player, and I went onto a connector to input video to the laptop. For software, I opted to use Loom as it could record input and the trial business account had unlimited recording length.

Converting page visitors into customers proved to be the most difficult part. The statistics showed that the advertising campaign was effective. I factored the customer acquisition cost into the pricing I offered.

I quickly realised why the other services priced their service as they did. It took hours for a single tape to be converted and storage was also a factor. I think the best part of this was figuring out the pricing and logistics to make it all work.
